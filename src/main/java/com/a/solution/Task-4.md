# Task 4 - Trends

One significant trend in enterprise applications over the last 2-3 years is the adoption of micro-frontend architecture.

Similar to microservices on the backend, micro-frontends break down large, monolithic frontends into smaller, independently developed and deployable modules. This approach addresses the growing complexity of enterprise applications and the need for faster, more flexible development cycles.

This trend is transforming corporate application development in several key ways. Firstly, it allows for independent team deployments, enabling multiple teams to work on different parts of the application simultaneously without conflicts. This reduces development bottlenecks and accelerates release cycles.

Secondly, it enables technology diversity, as teams can use different frameworks for their respective modules.

Lastly, it supports scalable architectures, as micro-frontends can be updated, tested, and deployed independently, improving system resilience and reducing downtime.

To prepare for this trend, I’ve actively engaged in projects with micro-frontend development at Budget Direct and Australia Post, where I worked with Webpack Module Federation to facilitate independent module sharing. I’ve also utilised Storybook for UI consistency and maintained clean architecture principles to ensure a clear separation of concerns.

Beyond work, I regularly read articles, attend developer meetups and explore new tools and libraries at work and home projects. This proactive approach ensures I remain proficient in emerging concepts, enabling me to contribute effectively to modern enterprise development.
