# Task 5 - User Value

One impactful project I worked on was at Virgin Australia, where we implemented a system for multivariate experimentation (MVE) on the airline's booking platform.

This approach allowed us to test multiple variations of features, layouts, and user flows simultaneously to identify which combination delivered the best user experience and business outcomes.

## Data-Driven Development
Instead of building features based on assumptions, we prioritised evidence-based decision-making. Using Adobe Analytics, we ran 4-5 simultaneous experiments on various elements, such as page layouts, button placements, and checkout workflows. This approach allowed us to see how users actually interacted with the platform, leading to more informed development decisions.

## User-Centric Iteration
By running multivariate experiments, we focused on creating a user-first experience. E.g. different versions of the flight search filters were tested. Data revealed that users preferred simpler filter options, so we scrapped complex configurations and opted for a more streamlined, user-friendly design. Each iteration improved user satisfaction, reduced abandonment rates, and increased booking conversions.

## Targeted Development
Traditional development often requires full features to be built before user testing, but with MVE, we only committed development resources once user preferences were clear. By analysing user behaviour and feedback in real time, we avoided wasting time on features that didnâ€™t add value. E.g. only the highest-performing design variations were fully developed, which reduced development time and effort.

## Personalised User Journeys
MVE also allowed us to personalise the user journey. By dynamically changing page layouts and content for different user segments, we increased engagement and conversions. E.g. Business travellers and leisure travellers were shown different flight options and add-ons, leading to better-tailored experiences.

## Continuous Improvement
The system was built to run continuous experiments, meaning we were always gathering fresh data for ongoing optimisation. This "always-on" experimentation model meant that Virgin Australia could continuously improve the platform, driving higher engagement and better business results. The underlying technical approach followed clean architecture principles, ensuring that new experiments could be added and removed without disrupting existing features.

## Conclusion
By leveraging multivariate experimentation, we ensured that only user-validated features were developed, reducing costs, increasing speed-to-market, and delivering an experience that was truly tailored to user needs. This project demonstrated the power of continuous testing, learning, and iteration to deliver high-value software.
